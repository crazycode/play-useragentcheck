# UserAgentCheck module for the play framework

## What is UserAgentCheck ?

UserAgentCheck provides an easy way to notify users when their browser is outdated. It displays a non disruptive banner at the top of the page and drives the user to a page where he/she may download an upgrade.
Optionally, it can block access to a browser if the version is older than the required one, e.g., html5 features needed.

## How does it work ?

It's no rocket science: the module provides a tag than may be included in your templates (typically `main.html`). In a nutshell, the module reads the user-agent header, figures the browser name/version and decides, based on your settings, if the banner should be displayed. 

To avoid redoing the same process on every request, it then stores the result in the session (which in Play translates to a cookie).

## Usage:

### Configuration

By setting properties in `conf/application.conf` the developer can control when the warning banner should display.

    useragentcheck.minInternetexplorerVersion = 7
    useragentcheck.minOperaVersion = 10
    useragentcheck.minFirefoxVersion = 5
    useragentcheck.minChromeVersion = 13
    useragentcheck.minSafariVersion = 5

With the sample lines above, the banner will show if you use IE6 or prior, Opera 9 or prior ...etc

By default, useragentcheck display a non disruptive banner. You may change this behavior by setting the following property:

    useragentcheck.block = true

In blocking mode, the user is redirected to an upgrade page where he/she can pick from a selection of upgrades.

You can allow other agents show your pages without banner or redirect by setting acceptOther property:

    useragentcheck.acceptOther = true

For example if you set `useragentcheck.block = true`, google-bot will be redirected and description in google search will contains `/agent` page.
If you set `useragentcheck.acceptOther = true` bots can use your pages content.

### Tag

You should include the `useragentcheck` tag somewhere in your template. Preferable right at the top of the html body.

    ...   
    <body>
    #{useragentcheck /}
    #{doLayout /}
    </body>
    ...

### Banner settings

The banner text and url may be configured using the standard `conf/messages` file. The default entries are

    useragentcheck.label=Your browser is no longer supported. Please click here to update...
    useragentcheck.url=http://www.google.com/chrome

### Routes

If you're planning to use the Blocking feature, add the following route in `conf/routes`

    # Import the default UserAgentCheck routes
    *	/	module:useragentcheck

### Override Block Template

If you want to customize Block Template, invoke the following command:

    play useragentcheck:ov-blockview

## Sample application

Two sample demos are part of the distribution.  

Process as follows in order to run them.

1. cd to **useragentcheck**
2. run `play dependencies .`
3. run `play build-module .`
4. cd to **samples-and-tests**
5. run `play depenencies demo-blocking` and `play depenencies demo-banner`
6. finally run the demo of your choice with `play run demo-xxx` and open a blowser on `http://localhost:9000`
